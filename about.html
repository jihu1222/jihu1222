          <p> I was born in California, and lived near LA for a small portion of my life. My family then moved to Colorado, where my mother began teaching. </p>
          <p> I have been coding since I was 10, and started off with block-based JavaScript coding, Minecraft command block coding, and later Python. </p>
          <p> I took many engineering classes in high school, where I learned how to do computer aided design, manufacture things in a workshop, and create complex logic gate circuits. </p>
          <p> I now am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Creative Technology and Design at University of Colorado Boulder. My major consists of coding classes, CAD classes, digital design classes, and much more. It's the perfect balance of engineering and art, both of which I love. </p>
          <p> I have 3 siblings, 2 of which also code. One is pursuing a game design degree at University of Colorado Colorado Springs and the other will be pursuing an engineering degree at Colorado School of Mines. My younger sister is still in high school, but she will likely pursue something similar. Sibling banter aside, I'm fond of all of them.</p>
