        <h3>Origins</h3><hr>
        <p> Funny Drink was invented by the awesome cool epic engineer, coder, artist, and moon specialist
          <a href="https://jihu1222.github.io/">Kai Hughes</a>. </p>
        <p> Kai is very silly and often has multiple open drinks on their desk and in their fridge. </p>
        <p> Thus they decided one fateful day during quarantine to just mix every open drink they had in one cup. </p>
        <p> Funny Drink was born, with the first one likely consisting of lemonade, sprite, and peach juice. </p>
        <p> Historians do not have sufficient evidence to determine the exact combination of drinks in the first Funny Drink, </p>
        <p> and can only speculate what was in it. </p>
